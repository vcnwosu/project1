Project 1

A simple HTML/JavaScript/CSS GUI project to process an array of JavaScript objects and display them on the web page in tabular format.

Added functionality includes drag and drop features to insert the tabular data into other elements on the page, consequently changing CSS styling.

Not mobile friendly. Implementation focuses more so on functionality than design across desktop and mobile devices.
